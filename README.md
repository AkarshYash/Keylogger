# Keylogger Software

This Python script implements a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a keylogger software using Tkinter. The keylogger records keypress events and logs them into a text file.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages:
  - tkinter
  - Pillow (PIL)
  - pynput

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required packages.
2. Open the script file (`keylogger_gui.py`) in a text editor.
3. Modify the `log_dir` variable to specify the directory where you want to save the keylog text file.
4. Optionally, update the paths for the background image and button images (`img3` and `img4` variables) if necessary.
5. Run the script using Python.

## Features

- **GUI Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for starting the keylogger.
- **Start Button:** Allows the user to start the keylogger by clicking on the button.
- **Logging:** Records keypress events and saves them to a text file in the specified directory.
- **Background Image:** Displays a background image on the GUI for aesthetic purposes.

## Important Notes

- This script is for educational purposes only.
- Use this script responsibly and ethically. Do not use it for malicious purposes.
- Be cautious when logging keystrokes, as it may infringe on privacy rights.
- Ensure that you have appropriate consent before using keylogging software.
- Consider adding additional features such as encryption or password protection for the log file for security purposes.
